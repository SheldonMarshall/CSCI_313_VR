Project 1 - VR Sound and Space | The Symphony
--

  The Symphony began as a concept of allowing the player to become a conductor of an orchestra. At the wave of a hand, they could activate the sounds of different sections and instruments. We conceptualized this as a simple room fit with a stage, chairs, and instruments. We didn’t want there to be any people playing the instruments, instead having the instruments dance and sway with a sort of sentience, as if they were playing themselves. These instruments would be able to sync together to create a complete song.
	Sheldon worked on the coding and music end of the project. He composed four tracks: winds, strings, brass, and percussion, each 8 looping bars that could fit together like puzzle pieces. He used blueprint coding to put these tracks on a loop that could mute and unmute at the click of a button. While the intention was for the player to control the music simply by conducting in the direction of the sections, the buttons were more suitable for our skillset.
	Olivia worked on the models and set design. She modeled the room in Maya and arranged the chairs, instruments, and podium, as well as tweaking certain models that had faulty or missing textures such as the bass drum and the trombone. After the setting was complete, she edited the lighting to add a spotlight effect.
	Many problems occurred with the looping of the instruments and the button features; the music wouldn’t mute or sync correctly. Sheldon had to try using Meta Sounds to fix this issue. We also did not have the time to animate the instruments. However, thanks to critique on Tuesday the 12th, we were able to iron out some other issues, such as uncertainty of button usage, as the buttons showed no indication of being clicked after being interacted with. To fix this, they now change color after being clicked.
	All in all, The Symphony wasn’t able to capture every idea we came up with, but it is still something we are proud of and worked hard on, and we believe it turned out well.
